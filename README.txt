**The Pantheon Content Publisher plugin for WordPress enables seamless content publishing from Google Drive and Google Docs directly to WordPress sites.**

Perfect for editorial teams who collaborate on content within Google Docs, this plugin ensures a smooth transition from document creation to web publishing, facilitating real-time previews and direct publishing options.

== Features ==

= Real-time Preview =
Experience seamless document previews within your WordPress environment as they would appear live on the web.

= One-click Publishing =
Enable direct publishing from Google Docs to WordPress, simplifying content management and streamlining workflows.

= Custom Post Type Support =
Publish content to any public post type registered on your WordPress site, including custom post types. Authors can also specify the target post type per document via metadata.

= Smart Components =
Embed rich media directly from Google Docs using the Content Publisher add-on. In the add-on sidebar, click Add Component, select Media Embed and enter a URL. Supported providers include YouTube, Vimeo, Spotify, DailyMotion, Flickr, Twitter/X, Instagram and any other provider recognized by WordPress oEmbed. Unrecognized URLs fall back to an iframe embed. Authors can set custom width and height per component — defaults are 100% width and 400px height. Components are rendered as native WordPress embeds on publish with no admin configuration required. Developers can register custom components via the `cpub_register_smart_components` hook.

= ACF Integration =
Sync Content Publisher metadata fields to Advanced Custom Fields (ACF). Navigate to Settings > Pantheon Content Publisher > Integration tab to define field mappings per post type. Each tab shows ACF fields from the field groups assigned to that post type — enter the exact Content Publisher metadata field name (case-sensitive) to create a mapping. Mapped values are automatically applied on every publish. Sync errors are displayed in the Integration tab and auto-clear after one hour. Requires the ACF plugin (free or Pro) to be installed and active. Works with custom post types.

For more information, please check [Pantheon Content Publisher documentation](https://docs.content.pantheon.io).

== Installation ==

The Pantheon Content Publisher plugin can be installed like any other WordPress Plugin, from your WordPress Dashboard, go to Plugins -> Add Plugin and search for: Pantheon Content Publisher, click the Install Now button and then click Activate.

After the plugin is active, set up your connection to Pantheon Content Publisher and Google Drive via the settings page in the WordPress admin dashboard.

Once connected:

* **Connection tab** — Configure collections and choose the target post type (including custom post types).
* **Integration tab** — Map Content Publisher metadata fields to ACF fields per post type (requires the ACF plugin).
* **Smart Components** — Work automatically with no extra configuration. Authors add media embeds from the Google Docs add-on.
