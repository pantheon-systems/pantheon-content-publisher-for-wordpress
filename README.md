## Repository Actions

This repository takes advantage of the following workflows to automate the release & testing processes:

- [PHPCS](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-content-publisher-for-wordpress/blob/primary/.github/workflows/php-style-lint.yml)
- [PHPCompatibility](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-content-publisher-for-wordpress/blob/primary/.github/workflows/php-version-compatibility.yml)
- [Release Drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter)
- [PR Labeler](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pr-labeler)
- [A custom workflow that builds release artifacts](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-content-publisher-for-wordpress/blob/primary/.github/workflows/release-artifact.yml)

These workflows will build a release draft and keep it up-to-date as new PRs are merged. Once a release is published, a
ready-to-install zip file will be generated and attached to the newly-published release.
To take advantage of these automations, make sure to read the available config files and workflow recipes, available in
the `.github` folder in the root of this repository.

Examples: _(read the config files for full configuration)_

- `feature/<branch-name>` or `feat/<branch-name>` adds the `feature` label to your PR
- PRs labeled `feature` will be categorized in the "🚀 Features" section of the release
- PRs labeled `major`/`minor`/`patch` will bump the major/minor/patch version number of the release
